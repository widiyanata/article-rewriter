# Product Context: Article Rewriter WordPress Plugin

## 1. Problem Solved

This plugin likely addresses the need for WordPress users to:
*   Quickly generate variations of existing content.
*   Refresh old articles without starting from scratch.
*   Improve SEO by creating unique content from existing posts.
*   Overcome writer's block by providing alternative phrasing.

## 2. Target Audience

*   WordPress site owners, administrators, and content editors.
*   Users who manage blogs, news sites, or content-heavy websites.
*   Individuals or teams looking for content generation assistance.

## 3. How It Should Work (Initial Assumptions)

*   Users can select text within the WordPress editor (Classic or Block) and trigger a rewrite action.
*   Alternatively, users might be able to rewrite entire posts/pages via an admin interface or a meta box.
*   A batch processing feature allows rewriting multiple posts/pages simultaneously.
*   Settings allow users to configure API keys (for the rewriting service), potentially select rewriting modes/tones, and manage their license.
*   The plugin integrates seamlessly into the WordPress admin workflow.

## 4. User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive:** Easy to understand and use, even for non-technical users.
*   **Efficient:** Speeds up the content creation/modification process.
*   **Integrated:** Feels like a natural part of the WordPress experience.
*   **Reliable:** Consistently produces usable rewritten content.
