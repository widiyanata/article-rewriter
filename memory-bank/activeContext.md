# Active Context: WordPress Article Rewriter Plugin

## Current Focus
We are in the initial implementation phase of the WordPress Article Rewriter Plugin. The primary focus is on:

1. Setting up the basic plugin structure
2. Creating the core plugin files
3. Implementing the admin settings framework
4. Establishing the database schema
5. Building the foundation for API integrations

## Recent Decisions
- Decided on a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Chosen to support both Gutenberg and Classic Editor
- Selected OpenAI and DeepSeek as initial API integrations
- Determined to use Envato API for license validation
- Opted for a custom batch processing system

## Active Considerations
- How to structure the API connectors for maximum flexibility
- Best approach for editor integration (blocks vs. sidebar)
- Database schema design for optimal performance
- User interface design for rewriting options
- Implementation strategy for batch processing

## Next Steps
1. Create the main plugin file with plugin header
2. Set up the includes directory structure
3. Implement the settings page and configuration options
4. Create the database tables
5. Develop the API connector framework
6. Build the editor integration components

## Open Questions
- Specific AI services beyond OpenAI and DeepSeek
- Rewriting styles and options to include
- UI preferences for both editors
- Batch processing requirements
- Reporting and analytics features

## Current Challenges
- Balancing flexibility with ease of use
- Ensuring consistent experience across different editors
- Managing API rate limits and costs
- Implementing secure and reliable licensing
- Designing an efficient batch processing system
